                First, let me discuss briefly the history of the query parameters, and
                why I think it took so long to get to where we are. As with many frameworks,
                Ember.js has a "convention over configuration" policy, which basically
                means the most sensible default is built-in, and any other use cases
                should be configurable. For Query Parameters, there are two main conceivable
                use-cases;
                -->
                <h3>The issues</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <!--
                At SRXP we have potentially long lists of data, sorted and filtered
                server side. This means a change in query parameters needs a fetch
                from the server. However, an equally conceivable use case is where
                all the data is already loaded, and sorting / filtering / anything
                is done on the client side.
                Implementing the latter would be relatively straightforward, since
                all complicated routing logic can be bypassed. This however provides
                no support for the former. Implementing the former would force a
                server-reload pattern on people who might not need it.
                -->
                <h3>Model (Route) vs. Controller</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Query string</h3>
                <!--
                Ember.js routing structures differ from classic server-side MVC
                in that each URL has multiple end-points, namely each route.
                The issue of having just one global query string is that
                we have to determine which parameter belongs to which route,
                because if we don't in the model-based option we'd have to
                refresh each route on a parameter change if we really
                need to change just one.

                Therefore matrix parameters were considered for a while (I was
                a big fan of this personally), but there were some objections;
                for one thing their unfamiliarity might scare people away. More
                importantly though, some web servers turned out not to support
                their URL-style, which would cause problems with resolving pushState
                URLs.

                <!--
                In either case, there was a need for query params, so
                people started writing libraries. The two main ones
                were ember-query by Alex Speller, and ember-query-params
                which was written by me. These libraries had similar
                features (route based, single query string) though
                their implementations were somewhat different. Both
                had to provide some nasty hacks to fool the router though
                since most relevant router code was hidden away in closures
                which could not be overridden in any way.

                <!--
                It was at this point that Alex and I started talking on GitHub
                about collaborating on a One True Solution for query parameters
                that could be merged into the Ember core. This was right before
                I went on vacation, and when I came back Alex had already
                done the awesome job of implementing the stuff on his own.
                This resulted in the first "native" query parameter
                implementation in Ember.js. This implementation borrowed a
                lot of ideas from our add-ons, query parameters were global,
                specified by the route, and affected the route's model.
                This of course again meant the controller-centered case was
                left out, and it required some nasty API-changes to routes...

                <!--
                ... therefore, within a few weeks this solution was replaced
                by the current solution, which was tremendously confusing
                for everyone not closely related to the process, since
                the documentation of the previous solution was actually
                already written and online for quite some time, and completely
                swapped out and replaced by something new. Code obviously
                also broke. However, this new implementation is very clean
                and supports all cases, so I would now like to briefly talk
                about how it works.
