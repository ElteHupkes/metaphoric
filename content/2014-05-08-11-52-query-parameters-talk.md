# Query parameters talk slides

Yesterday, I gave a talk about Query Parameters at the [Amsterdam Ember.js meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ember-js/). You can find the slides I
used [here](files/meetup-qp-presentation/ "Slides Ember.js Query Parameters presentation"). It was a great meetup, thanks everyone for being there!

**Update**: The talk itself has also been put online, you can
find it [here on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyD7CRuA-PU "Ember Query Parameters Talk")!
