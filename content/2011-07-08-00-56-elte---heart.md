# Elte - Heart

I took a few hours today to record a song with my still fairly new piano. Here it is on SoundCloud:

## Lyrics
My heavy heart’s a chandelier  
It carries you around like a candle  
but please don't light a fire in here  
it might be more than I can handle

My empty heart is like a hotel  
where you would sleep, though I don’t know you very well  
And when you left your room last night  
you kind of left a mess inside 

Yeah you did a number on my heart   
not so much that it fell apart but it is scarred  
because I tried, tried, tried, 
about as hard as I could’ve tried   
and I thought I might just get something out of it   
this time, this time   
I really though I got through to you this time   

My stupid heart just didn’t know  
That it was gonna end like that  
It never thought that you would go  
despite the differences we had  

Oh it's showing cracks where are you now?  
Could you hand it back to me somehow?  
Te way it was before I tried, tried, tried,  
not to get too caught up thought I might, might, might,  
might just get something out of it  
this time, this time,  
I really thought that I would get it right this time 

One day I will finally take a stand  
forcing you to make me understand  
because it freaks me out, it freaks me out  
that you’re all that I can think about  
why don't you leave my heart alone?  

and oh I tried so hard to make you mine  
and I really thought I got it right this time
