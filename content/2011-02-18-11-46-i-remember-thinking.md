# I remember thinking...

... wow, that's like, basic probability theory! I am so doing this right. And so, I switched.

Context: I dreamt I was in a game show. The host looked like the voiceover guy from one of those old
computer racegames: large round glasses, thick curled chestnut brown hair; didn't have to hear him speak to
know he was probably an asshole. I was given a choice of three doors: waiting behind one of them was a life without sorrow.
After picking a door the host would be so kind to point out one door that did not hold the candy, after which I'd
be allowed to switch. Classic [Monty Hall problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

So, I did it right. As right as theoretically possible. But that cheating bastard of a
host picked the right door himself. "You might just have made the right decision, why take that chance?"

Heaven forbid I'd ever win something inside my own head.
