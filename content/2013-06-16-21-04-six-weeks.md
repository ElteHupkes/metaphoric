# Six weeks
It walks! I just got my groceries without crutches, which is sort of a symbolic breakthrough for me ;).

I still have limited mobility, the thing (still thing - not yet knee) constantly feels weird 
(not painful - weird), but my list of possible exercises is expanding to include even some things that 
have the potential to get me tired and thereby raise my
endorphin levels. The next milestone should be cycling outside, which would solve pretty much all my transportation
problems here in the comparatively small city of Amsterdam. I'm hoping this won't take more than a few weeks.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some Game of Thrones episodes to catch up on.
