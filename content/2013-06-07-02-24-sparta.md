# Sparta
I don't mind injuries. I mean I do, obviously, nobody likes being in pain; but I think getting injured is an intrinsic
part of sports, an inevitibility when you're touching the boundaries of what you can and cannot do. During the twenty-two
years my life has occupied thusfar I've taken a few hits; hurt my ankle a couple of times, sprained my hamstrings,
probably some other stuff as well. Never like this torn ACL though. You see, all my previous injuries I have somehow
managed to recover from by myself.

My friends and I have an inside joke (one I'll take no credit for) whenever we see something or someone
deformed: "In ancient Sparta... they'd have just thrown it off a rock." And now
I kind of feel like I deserve to be thrown off that rock. I don't know if I'll ever fully recover from this, but if it
wasn't for medical science I could be sure that I wouldn't. It's probably just the crappiness of not being able to
walk regularly for three months talking - but I feel like my stubbornness has finally failed me.
It makes me feel weak. I've never felt weak before.

This shit sucks.
