# The bus

Now that I can't ride my bicycle (a big deal here in Amsterdam), I have to take the bus to [SRXP](http://www.srxp.com)
every day. I have to take two separate buses to get where I want. The funny thing is, it does not matter in which
direction I take them. Both go back and forth between two locations where their lines intersect, the points where I
have to get on / off are about in the middle. So whichever bus I take first, I get to take in whichever direction I
like.

I appreciate these little quirks. Unfortunately I do not appreciate having to ride the bus.
